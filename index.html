<h3>All About My Favorite Color</h3>


<p id="p1"><img src="images/Butter yellow.png" id="butteryellow"> My favorite color is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/annahaines/2025/03/31/the-butter-yellow-trend-explained/" target="_blank">butter yellow</a>. It is a pretty popular color, but many people do not understand why it is their favorite color; however, I can confidently explain to you why. First off, if a color is going to be my favorite color it has to look good wearing it. If someone chooses a favorite color but does not enjoy wearing the color, then that color can not constitute being your favorite color. Butter yellow looks good with anything. You can wear light washed jeans or dark washed jeans. It even looks good with sweatpants. Additionally, I can wear the color on any occasions, some colors are not suitable for all occasions like white or red, but butter yellow is the perfect color for a cozy day in or dressing up to go somewhere, therefore it looks good on all occasions. Next the color brings me joy. When you see a color like black you are depressed and saddened but butter yellow is the exact opposite of the color and joyful and brings memories of a warm summer day, sunshine, and flowers. I take joy in all of these things, and therefore since butter yellow reminds me of these joyful things, I associate the color itself with joy. <span class="highlight">Finally everything iconic comes in butter yellow.</span> I understand that is a bold statement to make, but some of the most iconic dresses and foods come in the color. The most iconic dress has to be the dress from How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days, it is perfect in every way and it is butter yellow, many people do not remember the scene in the movie but everyone remembers that dress. Additionally, who does not love butter, it is everywhere and makes everything better, from brown butter cookies to butter on pancakes, it is a quintessential food and the color of good butter is butter yellow. Not the bad pale butter, but the pigmented yellow butter like french butter. French butter is very iconic right now and it comes in the color yellow. Overall my argument stands that butter yellow is the best color, and also my favorite color. </p>

<h3>All About My Favorite Food </h3>

<p id="p2"><img src="images/Mint Choco Chip Ice cream.png" id="mintchocochip"> Some people argue that if something is your favorite food you should be able to eat it forever and not get tired of it. I wholeheartedly disagree with this argument, because the reality is good things come in small quantities. Your favorite food is simply the food that always hits the spot no matter what and you consistently enjoy eating. My favorite food is <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/best-mint-chocolate-chip-ice-cream-taste-test?srsltid=AfmBOorPcFKskRTSYI_jfHmBi_YXvw-yvr1M9Kqw3RrZxpEz6pVqApu8" target="_blank"> mint chocolate chip ice cream </a>. I really enjoy ice cream in general because it is so cold but creamy so it feels like a warm hug in the cold. A lot of people argue that ice cream can not be eaten in the cold, but I argue otherwise: it is fatty and creamy making it the perfect snack for a rainy day. <span class="highlight"> Mint chocolate chip is specifically my favorite food because the flavor is the perfect balance of not too sweet, chocolatey, and creamy. </span> Favorites like vanilla are very monotone and chocolate is too heavy and over powering. The flavors are, but not incredible by any means and they can easily be messed up, a bad vanilla or chocolate is not ever worth eating. But mint chocolate chip can never be bad, even if it is too sweet the chocolate and mint even it out, not sweet enough then the chocolate chip balances it, and too mint is not real because the creamyness of the milk makes sure the mint is never too over powering. When I finish eating mint chocolate chip ice cream I am not grossed out by the after taste because the flavor just keeps getting better. If you feel the need to drink water after eating something it means it just was not that good, but mint chocolate chip ice cream will never make me want to drink water, instead I would rather have the flavor in my mouth. Mint chocolate chip ice cream is my favorite food because of its perfect balance of flavors, failure to disappoint, and never leaving a bad taste in your mouth. </p>

<p id="p3"><img src="images/Fall seafront.jpg" id="fallharbor"> Living in San Diego, I should love the summer. But I have to say otherwise, although the summer in San Diego is amazing and enjoying the sunshine and beaches everyday is my perfect day, it is not my favorite season. <span class="highlight">Instead my favorite season has to be fall when the morning and afternoons are cool and mid day is still warm. </span> I only love the summer for what it allows me to do and not for the season itself, but instead in the fall I love the season. Fall comes with an abundance of cozy flavors like pecan, cinnamon, nutmeg and so much more. The spices make everything warm and cozy and just straight up delicious. All the stores roll out fall menus filled with <a href="https://sandiegomagazine.com/food-drink/fall-seasonal-coffee-tea-drinks/" target="_blank">  the best drinks </a> of the season. While this happens inside, outside the weather becomes perfect. The mornings are cool and foggy but mid-day is sunny and warm with the afternoons nice and cool. The morning is perfect to stay indoors and enjoy a slow and peaceful morning, with the fog creating a mystical and beautiful landscape. As the sun rises and the day warms up it is perfect to get outdoors and go to the beach. Unlike the summer where it is too hot to enjoy being outside without being near water, you can go anywhere mid day because the weather is just perfect. In the afternoon it is nice and cool, the perfect weather for a walk or run. You can enjoy a nice walk and not be sweaty afterwards. Because of the weather and the vibes that come with fall, fall is my favorite season. </p>
